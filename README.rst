ZAP (the Zurich Atmosphere Purge)
---------------------------------

Tired of sky subtraction residuals? ZAP them!

ZAP is a high precision sky subtraction tool which can be used as complete sky
subtraction solution, or as an enhancement to previously sky-subtracted MUSE
data.  The method uses PCA to isolate the residual sky subtraction features and
remove them from the observed datacube. ZAP was designed for MUSE data and has
been used sucessfully on KCWI and Subaru/FOCAS data.
